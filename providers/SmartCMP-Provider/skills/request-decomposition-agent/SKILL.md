# CMP Request Decomposition Agent

Orchestration agent for transforming descriptive demands into CMP request candidates.

## Purpose

When receiving free-form infrastructure/application requirements:
1. Parse and decompose into CMP-executable sub-requests
2. Match each sub-request to available CMP catalog services
3. Build structured request payloads with resolved/unresolved fields
4. Return draft requests for human review

**NOT autonomous fulfillment** — produces reviewable outputs only.

## Trigger Conditions

This skill activates when:
- Input is descriptive text (not a clean catalog request)
- `agent_identity` is `agent-request-orchestrator`
- `request_text` is provided

## Inputs

| Input | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `instance` | string | Yes | CMP provider instance name (e.g., `cmp-prod`) |
| `agent_identity` | string | Yes | Must be `agent-request-orchestrator` |
| `request_text` | string | Yes | Free-form requirement description |
| `request_title` | string | No | Short title for the request |
| `requester_context` | object | No | Metadata: application, BG, environment, urgency, budget |
| `submission_mode` | string | No | `draft` (default) or `review_required` |

**Validation Rules:**
- If `request_text` is empty → **Stop immediately**
- If `agent_identity` ≠ `agent-request-orchestrator` → **Stop immediately**

## Orchestrated Skills

This agent does NOT access CMP directly. It orchestrates:

| Skill | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `../shared/scripts/list_services.py` | List available service catalogs |
| `../shared/scripts/list_components.py` | Get component type information |
| `../shared/scripts/list_business_groups.py` | List business groups |
| `../shared/scripts/list_resource_pools.py` | List available resource pools |
| `../request/scripts/submit.py` | Submit assembled request (if mode allows) |

## Workflow

```
1. Parse Descriptive Demand
   └── Extract resource intents from request_text
         ↓
2. Extract Constraints
   ├── Environment (prod/dev/test)
   ├── Workload type
   ├── Expected scale
   ├── Availability/compliance hints
   └── Dependencies between resources
         ↓
3. Split into Sub-Requests
   └── One per CMP-executable unit
         ↓
4. Match to CMP Catalog
   └── ../shared/scripts/list_services.py → Find suitable entries
         ↓
5. Fetch Target Schema
   └── ../shared/scripts/list_components.py → Get required fields
         ↓
6. Build Request Payloads
   ├── Resolved parameters
   ├── Assumptions made
   └── Fields requiring manual adjustment
         ↓
7. Execute Based on Mode
   ├── draft → Return candidates, stop
   └── review_required → Create for human adjustment
         ↓
8. Return Decomposition Plan
```

## Decomposition Rules

**Prefer smaller, reviewable sub-requests over single oversized request.**

### Valid Decomposition Examples

| Component Type | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| Compute | Application runtime VMs |
| Database | Database service instances |
| Storage | Storage capacity allocations |
| Load Balancer | Ingress/traffic distribution |
| Network | Connectivity dependencies |
| Monitoring | Operational components |

### Handling Unsupported Components

- If no suitable CMP catalog service → Mark as **unresolved** for manual handling
- Do NOT invent components unsupported by catalog

## Decision Style

> Be explicit about assumptions and uncertainty.

- Separate extracted facts from inferred assumptions
- Prefer leaving fields unresolved over fabricating values
- If requirement too vague → Return partial plan with clarification gaps
- Optimize for operator editability, not full automation

## Output Contract

```json
{
  "decision": "decomposed_for_review",
  "summary": "Split the request into three CMP sub-requests.",
  "sub_requests": [
    {
      "service_name": "Linux VM",
      "status": "draft",
      "resolved_fields": ["cpu", "memory", "environment"],
      "unresolved_fields": ["business_group_id"],
      "assumptions": ["Production deployment inferred from description."]
    }
  ],
  "manual_followups": [
    "Confirm target business group.",
    "Review whether database HA is required."
  ]
}
```

## Failure Handling

| Scenario | Action |
|----------|--------|
| Catalog matching fails for all | Return structured failure with unresolved intents |
| Schema retrieval fails for one | Keep other valid sub-requests |
| Mode unsafe for execution | Return draft payloads only |
| Key fields guessed | Do NOT submit final requests |

## Example Decomposition

**Input:**
```
We need a web application environment with 2 frontend servers (4 CPU, 8GB RAM each),
a MySQL database with 100GB storage, and a load balancer for traffic distribution.
Production environment, high availability preferred.
```

**Output:**
```json
{
  "sub_requests": [
    {
      "service_name": "Linux VM",
      "quantity": 2,
      "resolved_fields": {"cpu": 4, "memory": 8192, "environment": "production"},
      "assumptions": ["Frontend servers use Linux OS"]
    },
    {
      "service_name": "MySQL Database",
      "resolved_fields": {"storage": 100, "environment": "production"},
      "unresolved_fields": ["ha_mode"],
      "assumptions": ["HA required based on 'high availability preferred'"]
    },
    {
      "service_name": "Load Balancer",
      "status": "unresolved",
      "reason": "No matching catalog service found"
    }
  ],
  "manual_followups": [
    "Confirm HA configuration for MySQL",
    "Manual setup required for load balancer"
  ]
}
```
